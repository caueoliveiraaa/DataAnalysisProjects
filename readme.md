# About the project:

Welcome to my DataAnalysisProjects repo, here are some of my basic portifolio projects related to data analysis.

# General information:

- **Programming Language**: The programming language chosen for the project is [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.12.1.

- **IDE**: The IDE used is VS Code with the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension.

- **Virtual Environment**: Use the command `python -m venv nome_do_ambiente_virtual` to create the virtual environment for the application.  

- **Libs and Frameworks**: Activate the virtual environment with the command `.\env\Scripts\activate` and install all the necessary libraries and frameworks with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Guides**: Read the `readme.md` files in each application and they will guide you through how to set up and run the apps individually.
